1. See Creating Units (Appearance only; can be a standard actor).
1. Add an RTSResourceSourceComponent.
1. Set the resource type and maximum and current resources of the source.
1. Set the gathering factor for increasing the yield of any gatherers (e.g. golden minerals in StarCraft).
1. If you want gatherers to enter the resource source (e.g. Refinery in StarCraft), check Gatherer Must Enter, set the Gatherer Capacity, and add an RTSContainerComponent.
